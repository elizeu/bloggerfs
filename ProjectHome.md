BloggerFS is a filesystem which combines FUSE, FUSE-j and Google Data API (Blogger) to enable Blogger users to manipulate their blog posts by using a file interface.

A user can mount a blog hosted at Blogger to list, read and create new posts by simply editting a file below a mounting point in Linux.
